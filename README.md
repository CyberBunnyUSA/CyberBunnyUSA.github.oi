Goal: Create 3 web applications from the similar (if not the same) datasets!

Project Deliverables:
One app with Leaflet
One app that uses the 2D map view with the ArcGIS Javascript API
One app that uses a 3D scene or globe view with the ArcGIS Javascript API

Description:
Find at least two datasets that are somewhat complementary and create a Leaflet app, an ArcGIS Javascript API 2D app, and a Javascript API 3D scene app for each using essentially the same data. If you can't use the same data in each app, I'd like the features to be similar in theme. I want you to create the same app multiple times so you can see the similarities and differences between these JavaScript mapping frameworks. While I want you to use the same or similar data for each map, you may find that using GeoJSON format might be an easier way to use data in Leaflet while a Webmap or Feature Service might be an easier approach using the ArcGIS Javascript API.Links to an external site.

Two Data Sets
USA Structures- This feature layer, utilizing Federal Emergency Management Agency data, displays footprints for all structures (buildings) greater than 450 square feet in the United States and its territories.

ACS Poverty Status Variables - Boundaries - This layer contains the most current release of data from the American Community Survey (ACS) about poverty status by age group. These are 5-year estimates shown by tract, county, and state boundaries.

Leaflet App Requirements:

Each app must have:

At least two layers, not including the base map. You can use different base maps in your Leaflet and ArcGIS Javascript API apps. 10 points app
Use some combination of point, line, and polygon features. I don't just want to see all points! 10 points per app
Your layers should each contain at least ten features. 10 points per app
Share the apps on Github as live, interactive maps when your code is done. 10 points per app
Include a popup on at least one layer. 10 points per app
Bonus Add a widget (legend, search, layer list, etc.) or button to one of the apps! 10 points
